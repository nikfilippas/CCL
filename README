WIP to move the entire CCL codebase to pure Python.
Current benchmarks show same accuracy and 1x-10x faster code.
Test install with `python setup.py install --user`.

Left to be done:
- correlations
- covariances
- FFTLog (there is fftw in Python, also hankl, one I've implemented myself via quad_qawfe)
but the only profile that uses FFTLog is Einasto.
- some bugfixes in angular cells
- bugfix in lensing kernel integral
- HALOFIT
- CosmicEMU

Other notes:
- Check usage of Cauchy repeated integration formula for double FFTLog.
